# MLND_P1: Predicting Boston Housing Prices
Machine Learning project to predict the housing prices in Boston.
This is the 2nd project in Udacity Machine Learning Nano-Degree program and focuses on Model evaluation and validation.

## Project Description

The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and if someone wants to be the best real estate agent in the area, he needs to be able to provide most accurate rates to his clients. Here we have decided to leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist client with finding the best selling price for their home. We have received the Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. Our task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then be used to estimate the best selling price for clients' homes.

In this project, we will apply basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home. We will first explore the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. Next, we will properly split the data into testing and training subsets, and determine a suitable performance metric for this problem and then analyze performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. This will enable us to pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data. Finally, this optimal model will be tested on a new sample and the predicted selling price will be compared to our statistics.
